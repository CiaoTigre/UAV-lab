# UAV lab

UAV labs spring 2018 (Instituto superior tecnico)

## Lab 1
* Mathematical model of the parot drone
* Simulations to estimate transfer function
* Experiments to compare the estimated transfer function vs actual data

## Lab 2
* 4 experiments were done to collect sensor data from the drone
* Design a Kalman filter
* Simulations with the Kalman filter
* Implemented it on the drone

## Lab 3
* Theory of trajectory tracking control
* Simulations of the controller for different trajectories
